"I did not develop the PHP we know today. Dozens, if not hundreds of people, developed PHP. I was simply the first developer.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
I actually hate programming, but I love solving problems.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
I really don't like programming. I built this tool to program less so that I could just reuse code.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
PHP is about as exciting as your toothbrush. You use it every day, it does the job, it is a simple tool, so what? Who would want to read about toothbrushes?<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
I was really, really bad at writing parsers. I still am really bad at writing parsers.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
We have things like protected properties. We have abstract methods. We have all this stuff that your computer science teacher told you you should be using. I don't care about this crap at all.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
There are people who actually like programming. I don't understand why they like programming.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
I'm not a real programmer. I throw together things until it works then I move on. The real programmers will say \"yeah it works but you're leaking memory everywhere. Perhaps we should fix that.\" I'll just restart apache every 10 requests.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
I do care about memory leaks but I still don't find programming enjoyable.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
I don't know how to stop it, there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the way.<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>
For all the folks getting excited about my quotes. Here is another - Yes, I am a terrible coder, but I am probably still better than you :)<div id=\"note\">[ Rasmus Lerdorf ]</div>";

// Here we split it into lines
$quotes = explode("\n", $quotes);
$notes = explode("\n", $notes);

// And then randomly choose a line
$chosen = wptexturize( $quotes[ mt_rand(0, count($quotes) - 1) ] );

// This just echoes the chosen line
function hello_hal() {
	global $chosen;
	echo "<div class='clear'></div><div id='hal9000'><a href='http://www.doc4design.com'></a><p id='quote'>$chosen</p></div>";
}

// Now we set that function up to execute when the admin_footer action is called
add_action('admin_notices', 'hello_hal');


// We need some CSS to position the quotes
function hal_css() {
	echo '<link href="'.get_bloginfo('siteurl').'/wp-content/plugins/hello-rasmus/hello-rasmus.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />'."\n";
